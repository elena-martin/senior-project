        <h1>GREAT PLATEAU TOWER</h1>
        <h2>Unlock the Great Plateau Region</h2>
        
        <h3>RAISING THE TOWER</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the Oman Au shrine and interact with the terminal to get magnesis, It’s effectively the power to move metal things, which (no coincidence) is exactly what you need to do in this shrine. </li>
            
            <li>You wake up from a deep slumber, and there’s only one way to go. Grab your Sheikah slate, put on some clothes and climb your way out of the cave. Turn right, head down the hill and speak to the Old Man. Feel free to pick up any Hylian shrooms you find along the way. You can safely ignore the tree branches, though.</li>
            
            <li>Talk to the Old Man and exhaust your dialogue options. Before you leave, pick up the torch sitting agains the wall behind him and the baked apple sitting next to the fire.</li>
            
            <li>Follow the path to the right of the Old Man and pick up the woodcutter’s axe that’s buried in a tree stump. Keep right, hop into the water and climb up to the top of the little island to pick up the rusty broadsword. </li>
            
            <li>Around this time, the same disembodied voice that woke you from your slumber will talk again and place a marker on your map. Follow the Sheikah slate using the waypoint on your map, and place it in the terminal. This raises the Great Plateau Tower (and many other towers across Hyrule). </li>

        <h3>REWARDS</h3>
        <p>Now that the tower has been activated, you can warp to it freely using the map on your Shiekah Slate.</p>
