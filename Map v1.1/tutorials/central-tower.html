        <h1>CENTRAL TOWER</h1>
        <h2>Unlock the Central Region</h2>

        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Accessing this tower is fairly easy. However, it is swarming with Guardians. Either be prepared for several tough enemies, or, if you've completed Divine Beast Vah Medoh, use Revali's Gale to fly over the Guardians and climb the tower.</li>
