        <h1>DAH KASO SHRINE</h1>
        <h2>A Minor Test of Strength | Central Region</h2>
 
        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>There’s no trick or puzzle to the Dah Kaso shrine in the Central Tower region — it’s to the west of the Great Plateau along the Digdogg Suspension Bridge. It’s just a straight-up fight against a guardian. We’re not going to give you step-by-step instructions here, just a few pieces of advice.</li>

            <li> Some tips for defeating the Guardian Scout:<br>
            - If you’re worried about the fight, check your meals for anything that will boost either attack strength or defense — whichever you feel is more lacking for you.<br>
            - When it tucks its arm(s) in and starts spinning its head, it’s about to fire its laser. Get out of the way.<br>
            - Use the pillars to help avoid its laser — each hit will drain a little over two hearts.

            <li>Make sure you hit the chest on your way out to pick up an ancient core.</li>
