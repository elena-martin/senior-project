        <h1>SHEE VENATH/VANEER SHRINES</h1>
        <h2>Twin Memories | Dueling Peaks Region</h2>
    
        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The two shrines of Shee Vaneer and Shee Venath in the Dueling Peaks tower region are a little different from other shrines — there’s no physics- or rune ability-based puzzles to figure out. All you have to do is visit both shrines and remember what you see.</li>
        
            <li>Here’s the spoiler: You have to make the floor in Shee Venath look like the floor in Shee Vaneer and vice versa. We’re going to walk you through how to figure this out on your own, or you can just skim over it and skip to the solution.</li>

            <li>Head into the Shee Vaneer — it’s the one on the south side of the river very high up on the cliff. After you ride the elevator down, turn to the left. Ride the platform up to get a view of the floor. Take a screenshot or draw yourself a picture (or see below). The arrangement of balls in bowls you see here is how you have to make the floor in Shee Venath look.</li>

            <li>Take the elevator back up and leave Shee Vaneer and paraglide across the river to Shee Venath — it’s to the north and a little west and at a lower elevation.</li>

            <li>Take the elevator down into Shee Venath and turn to the right. Ride the platform up to get a look at the floor in here. Take another screenshot or draw another picture (or see below) — this is the arrangement you need for Shee Vaneer.</li>

            <li>Drop to the floor and start moving the balls around to match how Shee Vaneer looked when you first arrived.</li>

            <li>When the door opens, head through. Turn left, climb the ladder and get your spirit orb.</li>

            <li>Consult your in-game map and fast travel back to Shee Vaneer to save yourself a lot of time and frustration. Take the elevator down and rearrange the balls to match your screenshot from Shee Venath.</li>

            <li>The ladder’s on your right this time when the door opens. Go claim your hard-earned spirit orb.</li>
