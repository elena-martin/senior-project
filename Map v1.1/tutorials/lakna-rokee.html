            <h3>MAIN QUEST</h3>
            <h4 class="quest"><i>"Find the Fairy Fountain"</i></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>When you first arrive in Kakariko Village, you’ll find the painter Pikango working on a masterpiece near the pond across from the main house. He’ll tell you about the Great Fairy Fountain nearby.</li>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RrphZih_jV4xQ-MnaDCoAKvPdfw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8150895/lozbotw_0001_Layer_4.jpg">

                <li>Talk to him and ask him to take you there. He’ll lead you up the hill on the north side of town and past Tal’oh Naeg shrine, but then he’ll run out of steam.</li>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BzjpJMO2XlvzP6ASaxyGRe9dKo4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8150889/lozbotw_0004_Layer_7.jpg">

                <li>Continue on without him, and take the left fork in the path. This will lead you straight to the Great Fairy Fountain. If you’re careful when you arrive, you can crouch and collect some fairies from the area around the fountain. (They’ll revive you when you die and restore some hearts.)</li>

                <li>Walk up and examine the seed pod-looking structure in front of you. You’ll need to fork over 100 rupees to actually meet the Great Fairy. Getting her to come out of her shell (seedpod?) allows you to upgrade your armor, in exchange for some monster parts.</li>

                <li>Before you leave, snap a picture of the fountain with your camera rune ability to take back and show to Pikango to close out this quest.</li>

            <h3>SIDE QUEST #1</h3>
            <h4 class="quest"><i>"Flown the Coop"</i></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Your next task is to complete the Flown the Coop side quest, and you pick it up from Cado, one of the guards outside of Impa’s house. If you watch him for a while, he’ll start up the hill toward his cucco coop and freak out.</li>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j8rzKf2d4X92zTXVa40KBjKKhlU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151365/lozbotw_0001_Layer_4.jpg">

                <li>It seems that several of his precious cuccos haven’t come home, and it’s up to you to find them. There are seven you have to find and carry back to the coop (or toss in from a distance, which is kind of satisfying). In no particular order, you can find them:
                        <br>- Next to Pikango and the pond with the goddess statue
                        <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T8a9viRaTelXPitEHuvdjyOxC1A=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151357/lozbotw_0005_Layer_7.jpg" class="chickens">

                        <br>- On the roof of the clothing shop directly across from Cado’s coop
                        <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEFp8MqVJiJJJWA-IN9sxW-sXYQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151353/lozbotw_0007_Layer_10.jpg" class="chickens">

                        <br>- In front of a shed next to a campfire a little farther up the hill
                        <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4C9pdqjVE-KO75We5e2E3p9YYOU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151349/lozbotw_0009_Layer_12.jpg" class="chickens">

                        <br>- On top of a shed-thing in the northeast corner of the town near the watermill
                        <img src="" class="chickens">

                        <br>- In Mellie’s plum garden. If she’s standing watch, you won’t be able to grab it — wait for her to leave (or sit by a fire until night)
                        <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ObeDBopY8d9-8SWJnv-OTNzaDPc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151345/lozbotw_0011_Layer_14.jpg" class="chickens">

                        <br>- In a shed on the south side of town
                        <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7G6I4C7GFVZ6eLtZnSDRVioYgAA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151371/lozbotw_0013_Layer_16.jpg" class="chickens">

                        <br>- Near the apple tree just south of Tal’oh Naeg shrine on the north side of town
                        <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7fP8wGAFxtIM8Wy75LhYB8MrZmA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151367/lozbotw_0015_Layer_18.jpg" class="chickens">
                <br>Some of these are not great descriptions, but they’re kind of the best description we can give. Check the images above for the visual locations of each cucco.</li>

                <li>Once you’ve tossed all the cuccos back into the coop, talk to Cado again to close out the quest (and to get a 50 rupee reward).</li>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lbmVlcq4cEYy6hFi8wTc-BRSOSU=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151375/lozbotw_0016_Layer_19.jpg">
                </ol>
            
            <h3>SIDE QUEST #2</h3>
            <h4 class="quest"><i>"By Firefly's Light"</i></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The third step in unlocking the Lakna Rokee shrine is actually pretty straightforward — you just have to complete the By Firefly’s Light side quest. You’ll pick up this quest by visiting Lasli in her house at night. She’ll tell you how much she misses catching fireflies.</li>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3kADF_gcjDy5oxchz8PYCEp_Zk=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151435/lozbotw_0003_Layer_6.jpg">

                <li>Your job is to bring the fireflies to her — five of them, to be precise. If you’re lucky (or a hoarder like we are), you might already have the fireflies in your inventory. If you don’t, head back outside and crouch. There are usually a few outside her house at night. (You can also occasionally buy them from Beedle.)</li>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/17-Vnbr5TyvkPOF-e1w90HwRwIw=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151433/lozbotw_0004_Layer_7.jpg">

                <li>Once you have at least five of them, select the fireflies in your inventory, hold five of them, then drop them inside her house. She’ll reward you with another 50 rupees. (And then, before you leave, jump around her room and reclaim all of those fireflies because they’re a pain to catch out in the wild.)</li>
                <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZf1KOu5vDi4wHsPSaA06L-g1es=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151437/lozbotw_0008_Layer_11.jpg">
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>SHRINE QUEST</h3>
        <h4 class="quest"><i>"The Stolen Heirloom"</i></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>When the three quests mentioned above have been completed, something new will happen the next time you talk to the guards in front of Impa’s house. It seems that a thief visited in the night and stole a precious artifact from Paya.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7iSdNJxj1FqWSxVTS-ulzJe499M=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151707/lozbotw_0002_Layer_5.jpg">

            <li>Play out the rest of the conversations and spend the day with Paya (she’s the other woman in Impa’s house). There’s nothing to do here, but it sets up the timing for the end of this shrine quest.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ks77J2JMi4c16I7RmAOXCq-QlOQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151701/lozbotw_0005_Layer_8.jpg">

            <li>Once you’ve put Paya to bed, head outside and hang out by the fire and Pikango. Sit by the fire until night. When you get up, you’ll have to wait a few seconds more, but before too long (at 10:00 p.m.), Dorian will leave his post and start walking up the hill.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JjBt_PMZb02f2Iadn2xPjB41YE8=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151697/lozbotw_0007_Layer_10.jpg">

            <li>Give him a bit of a head start, then follow him up the hill. Keep your distance — now would be a good time to eat a stealth-increasing meal or elixir. Don’t get too close or Dorian will notice you and ruin the whole thing.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/npAJ3I94DcIBsiqGa2XvDhBMmsM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151695/lozbotw_0008_Layer_11.jpg">

            <li>Dorian will keep heading up the hill, past the Tal’oh Naeg shrine. He’ll continue into the woods along the same path you followed to find the Great Fairy Fountain. He’ll take the righthand branch at the fork, though. Keep following from a distance.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qBns2j5zoBAGxlpqQdlunJyECoA=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151689/lozbotw_0011_Layer_14.jpg">

            <li>When he crosses the bridge, let him get a little farther ahead of you — he seemed to be able to hear us following much better on the bridge — and save your game. Spoiler: there’s a really tough fight coming up and you don’t want to have to replay that long, slow walk.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EFMIguFfRmod2W8ZfbIyUBUkQdY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151683/lozbotw_0014_Layer_17.jpg">

            <li>After Dorian is across the bridge, it’s your turn to cross. This will trigger a cutscene that will lead to a fight with a Yiga jerk.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/boLNfChog-ert7-nn6U6Yr_C-wE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151715/lozbotw_0015_Layer_18.jpg">

            <li>Here’s the deal: This dude is tough. Super tough — in that he can easily drain five hearts worth of health with a single hit. Here’s how we handled it: unload every elemental arrow you have while staying well out of reach of that terrifying sword. We took him down with five fire arrows and a few bomb arrows.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CpMSz-lljUn92bN1ixcU9ANO2A=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151745/lozbotw_0001_Layer_4.jpg">

            <li>After the fight, the Yiga jerk will drop the heirloom, and you’ll have a long conversation with Dorian. At the end, your job is simply to pick up the heirloom and drop it into the shrine pedestal. You can also pick up the Windcleaver, a powerful sword that the Yiga jerk dropped upon defeat.</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8koBNMC4wpkJ7ntX35N9dDzA23E=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8151749/lozbotw_0006_Layer_9.jpg">

        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>After all of that work, the inside of Lakna Rokee shrine is rightfully simple. Just walk in, grab the very nice Edge of Duality out of the chest, and pick up your spirit orb.</li>
