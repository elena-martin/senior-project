        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>

            <li> Inside, you’ll find a minor test of strength, which involves a Guardian Scout II. As always, use Guardian weapons, because they’re the most powerful against their namesakes. And use the pillars as cover when the attacks get too strong. </li>
            <li>Your enemy wields a Guardian Spear+ and an Ancient Battle Axe+, which you’ll get as a rewards for defeating it. You'll also find a treasure chest on your way out, just before meeting Namika Ozz and collecting your spirit orb.</li>
