        <h1>SAAS KO'SAH SHRINE</h1>
        <h2>A Major Test of Strength | Central Region</h2>

        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finding Saas Ko'sah shrine is tough. It’s in Hyrule Castle’s Dock. The quickest path there is to head northwest of Hyrule Castle, and look for … well, something like a large cave heading into the rocks surrounding the castle. From the position you can see below, you can paraglide over the moat and onto the path that takes you into the Dock. </li>

            <li>Your trouble is just beginning, though. Between you and the shrine, there are several notably difficult Black Lizalfos monsters. Then again, there’s also a Flameblade you can pick up on your in.</li>
            
            <li>Saas Ko'sah shrine is also hidden. To get in, you’ll need to climb the staircase and ignite the giant urn … thing. (A swing of the Flameblade will do the trick.) Doing so will cause Saas Ko'sah shrine to rise from its … grave?</li>

            <li>Inside Saas Ko'sah shrine, you’ll face a major test of strength, which involves a Guardian Scout IV. This is at tough as it gets. In addition to the video above, here are some tips:<br>
            - As always, use Guardian weapons, because they’re the most powerful against their namesakes. <br>
            - There are no pillars to use as cover, but you can pluck large metal cubes from the ground when you need them. <br>
            - Buy the ancient armor from the Akkala Tech Lab. It gives you great Guardian defense, and this is pretty much exactly the situation you’d buy it for.
            </li>

            <li>Your enemy wields a Ancient Battle Axe++, a Guardian Spear ++ and a Guardian Sword++, all of which you’ll get as a reward for defeating the Guardian Scout IV. You'll also find a treasure chest with a Flameblade (Attack Up + 15) on your way out, just before meeting Saas Ko'sah and collecting your spirit orb. </li>
