        <h1>DUELING PEAKS TOWER</h1>
        <h2>Unlock the Dueling Peaks Region</h2>

        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> This tower is hard to miss. If you're following the footpath to Kakariko Village, you will see it on the left. Either make your way across the river, or paraglade off a nearby hill to begin your ascent to the top.</li>
