        <h1>NOYA NEHA SHRINE</h1>
        <h2>A Minor Test of Strength | Central Region</h2>

        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The most difficult part of Noya Neha shrine is finding it and getting in. It’s northeast of Central Tower, near Hyrule Castle. But it’s also hidden. To get in, you’ll need to use a flame arrow or its equivalent to burn away the thorny branches preventing you from entering the cave in which it sits (and some remote bombs to clear the cracked rocks along the way).</li>

            <li> Inside, you’ll find a minor test of strength, which involves a Guardian Scout II. As always, use Guardian weapons, because they’re the most powerful against their namesakes. And use the pillars as cover when the attacks get too strong.</li>
            <li>Your enemy wields a Ancient Battle Axe (Attack Up + 12), which you’ll get as a reward for defeating it. You'll also find a treasure chest with a Knight’s Shield on your way out, just before meeting Noya Neha and collecting your spirit orb. 
            </li>
