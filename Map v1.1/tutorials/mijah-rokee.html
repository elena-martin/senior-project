        <h1>MIJAH ROKEE SHRINE</h1>
        <h2>A Modest Test of Strength | Ridgeland Region</h2>
    
        <h3>SHRINE QUEST</h3>
        <h4 class="quest"><i>"Under a Red Moon"</i></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Breath of the Wild’s Under a Red Moon shrine quest is located southwest of Ridgeland Tower, in an area on your map called Washa’s Bluff. </li>

            <li>When you arrive in the area, listen for Kass, the Rito playing the accordion. He’s standing atop the flat-topped tree-like structures. Climb up, Speak to Kass, and he’ll give you the Under a Red Moon shrine quest and sing these words:</li>
            <quote>When the moon bleeds and the fiends are reborn / The Monks will invite you as they have sworn.
                But first you must stand on the pedestal bare / With nothing between you and the night air.
            </quote>

            <li>In short, you have to wait for a blood moon and stand on the round area on the ground beneath Kass. Doing that is as simple as it is time-consuming. You have a few options:
                <br>- Use flint and wood to make a series of fires, waking up at night and waiting for the next full moon (which is also a blood moon).
                <br>- Just keep playing, and remember to return to Kass during the next blood moon. 
                <br>- Visit an inn — or better yet, Link’s house — and keep sleeping until night, walking outside, waiting until you can see the moon and warp to Ridgeland Tower when the moon is red (as shown below). 
            </li>

            <li>If you leave, just make the shrine quest active in your menu, and you'll get a waypoint to show you how to get back there. Arrive, take off all of your clothes, weapons and armor, stand on the platform, and you’ll unveil Mijah Rokee shrine.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Inside Mijah Rokee shrine, you’ll find a modest test of strength with a Guardian Scout III. It’s a tough fight, intended for players who’ve spent a significant amount of time in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
                <br>
                <br>As always, use Guardian weapons, because they’re the most powerful against their namesakes. And use the pillars as cover when the attacks get too strong. Your enemy wields a Guardian Sword+ and a Guardian Shield+, which you’ll get as rewards for defeating it.
            </li>

            <li>On your way out, open the treasure chest for a Frostblade (Attack Up +12). Then you can meet Mijah Rokee, collect your spirit orb and leave.</li>
