        <h1>KATAH CHUKI SHRINE</h1>
        <h2>A Minor Test of Strength | Central Region</h2>

        <h3>TUTORIAL</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The most difficult part of Katah Chuki shrine is getting to it. It’s northeast of Central Tower, near Hyrule Castle. But to get there, you’ll need to fight (or avoid) several Guardians. </li>
        
            <li> Inside, you’ll find a minor test of strength, which involves a Guardian Scout II. As always, use Guardian weapons, because they’re the most powerful against their namesakes. And use the pillars as cover when the attacks get too strong.</li>

            <li>Your enemy wields a Guardian Spear, which you’ll get as a reward for defeating it. You'll also find a treasure chest with a Royal Halberd on your way out, just before meeting Katah Chuki and collecting your spirit orb. </li>
