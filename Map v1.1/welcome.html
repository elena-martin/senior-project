        <p class="welcome-page">Welcome to your one-stop guide and checklist for <i>Breath of the Wild!</i>
        <br>
        Let me tell you a bit about how this site works:
        </p>
        <h3 class="welcome-headers">VIEW TUTORIALS</h3>
        <p class="welcome-page"> The tutorials featured on this site were created by Polygon. They include shrine/quest walkthroughs, as well as the potential in-game rewards for each objective.
            There are two ways to view these tutorials:
        </p>
        <h4>View a Tutorial from the Map</h4>
        <p class="welcome-page">The interactive map allows you to explore shrine locations around Hyrule. Click and drag the map to navigate, and use the zoom controls to resize the map.</p>
        <h4>View a Tutorial from the Checklist</h4>
        <p class="welcome-page">Clicking the icon in the upper left corner of the screen will display a list of every shrine and tower in Hyrule. Clicking on an item from this list will also display the guide for the corresponding objective.</p>
        
        <h3 class="welcome-headers">TRACK YOUR PROGRESS</h3>
        <p class="welcome-page">At the bottom of each tutorial, you can easily mark the corresponding objective as "complete". As you complete shrines, their icons on the map and in the checklist sidebar will turn completely blue, just like in the game!</p>
        <div id="incomplete-ex" class="example">
            <h4>Objective Incomplete</h4>
            <p><i>The default objective status</i></p>
            <img src="icons/ShrineIcon-incomplete.svg" class="icon-ex">
        </div>
        <div id="complete-ex" class="example">
            <h4>Objective Complete</h4>
            <p><i>Manually marked as complete</i></p>
            <img src="icons/ShrineIcon.svg" class="icon-ex">
        </div>
        <h3 class="welcome-headers">UPDATES COMING SOON!</h3>
        <p class="welcome-page">This website was created from the ground up by one person, for educational purposes. I will continue to update the site to include quality-of-life changes over time, so be sure to check back every now and then!
